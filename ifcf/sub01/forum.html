                    The International Financial Cooperation Forum (IFCF) is jointly hosted by the Financial Services Commission of Korea and CIFC. The IFCF is hosted annually to bring together financial leaders from around the world to share insights and experiences to broaden the understanding of the changing financial environment and to deepen global financial cooperation.<br/>
                    Over the last eight IFCF’s, CIFC and its global partners have forged valuable long-term relationships for sharing financial knowledge and strengthening cooperation. CIFC sincerely believes that the 9th IFCF will serve as a guide in overcoming new challenges ahead for the global financial community.
